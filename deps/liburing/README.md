# liburing 2.10

Vendored from [here](https://github.com/axboe/liburing/releases/tag/liburing-2.10). We only need the headers, but we can't get them through the build system, as the upstream repo contains files with an extenion of `.3` which isn't allowed on Windows, breaking cross compilation.

As such, we've copied the required files into `include`.

A few hand created files are also provided, details follow.

## io_uring_version.h.in

This is a straightforward transformation of the version header generated by liburing at build time.

## compat.h

This file's generation is slightly more involved. The original shell script detects whether or not various features are available by attempting to compile programs that use them, and then checking whether the compilation failed or not.

To avoid a dependency on the shell, we've hand translated them to autopconf undef style config headers.
