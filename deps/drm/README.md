# DRM 2.4.124

No, not that kind of DRM.

Headers vendored from [here](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/libdrm/). This repo does not provide a single top level license, but each file has a brief description of allowed usage at the top.

We couldn't include this package via the build system, as it contains symlinks which breaks cross compilation from Windows.
